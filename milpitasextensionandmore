    <h2>Milpitas Extension</h2>
    <p>
      I went to Milpitas Extension from June 27 to July 21.
      My classes were from Mondays to Thursdays and from 10 AM to 2 PM.
      The only Monday we didn't attend these classes was July 4.
      There were 39 students and about eleven adults who were professors or assistants. Two students dropped out.
      We were divided into two groups. My group learned about mental health and college stuff first.
      We did study hall last. The other group did study hall first.
      They learned about mental health and college stuff last.
      The groups were together when their professor taught HTML from 11 AM to 12 PM. They were also together during lunch from 12 PM to 1 PM.
      On the first week, the adults gave us Subway for lunch.
      After the first week, they gave us Subway every Monday and Wednesday and Pizza Box every Tuesday and Thursday.
      Some guest speakers working at big companies would come to talk to us during lunch.
      We had a final exam on July 21 in our mental health class. The remaining 37 students each got certificates on July 21.
      We also had to present our websites in our study hall from July 19 to July 21.
      <br>Before you ask, yes, I presented this website to my class because this website was made for Milpitas Extension.

<h2>Family Reunion</h2>
<p>
From late July 2022 to August 7, 2022, I had a family reunion. I saw fourteen of my second cousins and all seven of my first cousins (at the time) on my dad's side.
My paternal grandfather has six younger siblings and three of them attended the reunion.
Ten of my second cousins are the grandchildren of my great-uncle and four of my second cousins are the grandchildren of my other great-uncle.
My great-aunt and her husband stayed in my house from late July 2022 to August 9, 2022.
Sadly, my aunt, my dad's youngest sister, didn't come because she was pregnant with her first daughter.
<h2> End of Summer</h2>
<p>
On August 8, I got my braces off after having them for two years. Seven days later, I got retainers.
<br>I started tenth grade on August 10. I didn't really like that year of school because I had a class that I kept blaming for keeping me up late at night.
