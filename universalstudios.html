  <h2 class="box">Summary</h2>
<p class="box">
I went to Universal Studios on June 11 with some of my family and friends. My friend's family went in a different car.
It was supposed to take our family forty minutes to get from our hotel to Universal Studios.
Instead, it took two hours. That's because we made a stop at a Vietnamese bakery, went the wrong way, and got stuck in traffic.
All of us stayed at Universal Studios from 11 AM to about 8 PM.
</p>
<h2 class="box">I did the following activities at Universal Studios in order:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The World-Famous Studio Tour</li>
  <li>Lunch (ate food from Vietnamese bakery)</li>
  <li>Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey™</li>
  <li>Jurassic World – The Ride</li>
  <li>Revenge of the Mummy – The Ride</li>
  <li>Panda Express for meal between lunch and dinner</li>
  <li>TRANSFORMERS™: The Ride-3D</li>
