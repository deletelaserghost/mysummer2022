<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I went to Washington DC from June 4 to June 9. June 4 was two days after my last day of ninth grade.
I went with people who went to my middle school. Some of them also went to my high school because they were the same age as me. The other students were about a year younger than I was.
I and the other people who were my age were planned to go to DC in 2021, but the trip was delayed by the pandemic.
<br>At the trip, each student got a Till debit card and they could spend it on food or on gift shops. They had to give their cards back on the last day. Unfortunately, I didn't spent all of my money on my card before I gave it away.
We also stayed in two hotels and both hotels gave us free breakfast. I shared a room with two other girls.
Each chaperone had to look after two rooms, so I, my roommates, and four other girls in a different room had the same chaperone.
There were five chaperones, one tour director, and one bus driver.
Oh, and we all were stuck with the same roommates and chaperones during the whole trip.
<br>After going home from Washington DC, I was at my house for less than 24 hours before the next big event.</p>
